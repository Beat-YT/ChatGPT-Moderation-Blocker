## Chat GPT anti censorship
This is a little extension I put up in a few minutes after I discovered that chat GPT was using an endpoint for content reporting.

Update: ChatGPT changed the way moderation works, so unfortunately, this extension no longer works.
I will update this extension if I find a workaround for the new moderation system, but that's unlikely to happen. 

The crx is available for download on the [releases page](https://github.com/Beat-YT/ChatGPT-Moderation-Blocker/releases)
and on the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chat-gpt-anti-censorship/aaibfgjceomfbogoicgjjlabohghmelm)

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT⚠️
**This extension does not block chat gpt integrated filter, it will still refuse to answer like "sorry this is violating open ai policy"
check the features below**

Use wisely.
